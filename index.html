<h1>Important Concepts</h1>
  
<h4>The internet, the web, browsers and HTML</h4>
 <p>
   The <b>internet</b> is a way that allows computers (phones, tablets, servers etc) around the world to talk to one another. 
  We send these information packets (bytes) through LAN cables or through WiFi.
  It used to be just text. 
   
  Now computers talk using a new language called HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) to create a web page.
  So instead of just text, HTML allows the webpage to be in a graphical format.
  We will need a <b>browsers</b> to view HTML in a graphical format, which you will know it as a webpage.
  All these web pages is collectively known as the <b>world wide web</b> or commonly known as the web.
   
  So the internet is the physical highway between computers, the vehicles on the highway are the packets of information.
  There are many different types of vehicles now. The car is like the web traffic, the trucks like the email traffic and the motorcycles like your music, video, picture traffic. So the internet contains the the web, email, music, video, pictures etc.

<h4>HTML terms</h4>
 <p>
  HTML stands for <i>Hypertext Markup Language. </i>
  HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. 
</p>


<h4>Tags and Elements</h4>
 <p>
  HTML documents are made of HTML elements. 
  When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by 
  using HTML tags. Eg <b> tag = bold
</p>


<h4>Why Computers are Stupid</h4>
 <p>
   Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. 
   Every tag has to be correct for the computer to understand what you want it to do.
</p>

<h4>Inline vs Block Elements</h4>
 <p>
   HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. 
   Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside 
   of them.
 </p>
  
 
<h4>So how does everthing work together?</h4>
  <p>
  When you enter the url for a webpage like www.google.com, 
  your computer sends a <i>HTTP Request to a server</i> using HTML.
  The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to your computer.
  Your <i>web browser</i> on your computer will interpret the HTML into the webpage 
  that you ultimately see on your computer screen.
